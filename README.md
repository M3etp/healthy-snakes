## How to Play
The game is designed for laptop and PC users. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake around the screen. Eat as many apples as you can to increase your health, but avoid eating pizza or you will lose length. The game ends if you hit a wall or if the snake's length becomes zero.
